### Elections-Audit Summary

In summary, with the three available data elements in the election_results.csv file, we were able to capture the total number of votes cast as a whole, per county and per candidate. With this data, we were able to present the votes as a count and percentage as well as determine the winner of the election. 

If modified to do so, this script can be used for larger elections by collecting votes by county and state. In addition to using this script to determine the winner of an election, this script can be modified to bring in additional data elements, such as age and demographics, that can help future candidates better understand the poulation they would like to reach to bring in more votes.
